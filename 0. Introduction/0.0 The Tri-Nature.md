# 0.0 The Tri-Nature
The Tri-Nature of Everything is a theory that states that everything in our universe is comprised of three main parts. These parts are Resources, Identifiers and Exposures. Each one of these components play a crucial role in the survival, evolution and fulfilment of that very system.

Our universe is a massive container of systems within systems. It follows a fractal pattern that makes it easier for the mind to comprehend and grasp. These systems work together to push our very existance towards a higher Purpose. Understanding these systems and properly identifying and categorizing it's resources, purposes and exposers is the very first step in understanding our universe as a whole.

This book will walk through each one of these components, then I will show you from every field in life, every historical event and book how the Tri-Nature pattern presents itself for those who look deeply enough. The purpose of this theory is to give everyone out there a beacon so they can hopefully find their purpose and hopefully know how to fulfill it.
